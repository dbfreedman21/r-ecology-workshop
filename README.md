# R Ecology Workshop Portfolio

This repository documents my structured practice through the *Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists* curriculum.  
The goal is to demonstrate clear, incremental mastery of core R skills including data import, cleaning, visualization, transformation, and reproducible workflows.

Each folder, script, and commit is organized to show deliberate progression rather than scattered experimentation.
